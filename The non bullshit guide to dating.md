All the ways:
1. Cold Approach Pick Up
2. Social circle
3. Work
4. Celebrity/Status
5. Online Game apps
6. Money (You know what)
7. Don't be so stressed about it. Test your theories in practice.

Cold approach 
- Striking up conversation with strangers in flirty way to get number and dates. Streets, malls, bars, clubs, etc for attractive women. Most hardcore direct approach
- This the most important way to build the skill set of picking up women
- Its a numbers game and you learn by failing. My personal note that this for me is the hardest given my introverted nature. But i am strong physically and it has transencede into my pshcy to build my mental fortitude.
- Works everywhere without much initial effort.
- The volume is useful as you will fail a lot and learn from this failure with each and every step.
- Cold approach for a nomad like me who does not have lot of friends is perfect.
- Attractive girls will look for status, social value, value,
- 

2. Social Circle 
	- Seriously does not work for me. As it requires good groundwork having large network of friends which i don't have given my previous depression.
	- The current ones aren't useful in this regard or for any other regard in that matter.
	- Its indirect and it takes maintenance. The guy in the office called shivam had this approach. 
	  If you move cities this approach is done.
	- To get the quality that i endear will require a huge social circle. It is not possible for me mentally to manage so many people when i haven't done anything like it before.
	- Attractive women are easy in social circle as i stand no chance in cold approach. People in this regard have lots of options from other people who will out weigh me in looks and money. Hence, having a large social circle of good looking people will be useful.
	- A large social circle with good looking women will attract other good looking women. You can triumph in this case.
	- Throws big parties need money and use it as networking event. 
3. Laid through Work
	- Risky

5. Online game:
	- Only looks matter in this domain.
	- Be in top 10 % of males in appearance.

### What is considered creepy ?
- Guys without any game, totally inexperience, never approach women, blackpilled doomer incels, never learned theory of attraction, not have a lot of deep experience (into the you know here experience), socially awkward etc
What is the idea ?
- Transform myself into high quality man who girls would want to give a chance to be their boyfriend/husband. Become a someone who a girl would want physically.
- Sense of humor, playfulness, emotional, instead of being a logical nerd (the logical nerd part tell them it's a lucky guess or fluke or god's will)


### Reasons for not getting laid:
- Not being social enough. You cannot get anything from home. Rest of the things that i tell myself in the head are just bs excuses.
- Ask yourself each day how many attractive women you have come across. If you do not do the volume you are not going to get the numbers down. And obviously it will not translate to anything substantial.
- Spending too much time inside home rather than going our or being social. Human interaction requires you to go out of your house. 
- Fundamental change in lifestyle required. Last decade has been pretty antisocial. I am not a virgin but still i have decided more times to stay at home then roam around.
- Pain of mainitaning your introverted lifestyle > Pain of going out and mixing with people.
3rd Reason: You are not approaching any women 
4th Reason: You lack flirting skills. Communicating them with in a logic / friendly / business manner.
5th Reason: What attracts women ? you do not know about it.
6th Reason: Many limiting beliefs about yourself. Correct your victim mindset. It's your life and your rules. You decide everything for yourself. What ever comes under your scope you totally control it. I always feel like that i will get rejected if i approach and with this thought i self sabotage myself. I am not doing a crime, this is perfectly legal if done with common sense.
7th Reason: Entitlement, seriously women have no need or reason to be with you. Society expects you as a man to approach women.

Want attractive women you have got to put in the effort. Get rid of protocols, dating app premium, dating courses etc. Your victim mentality and laziness is used against it.
