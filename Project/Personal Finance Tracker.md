## Project Overview: Personal Finance Tracker

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Implement user registration and login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to manage user sessions securely.
- **Dashboard**: Create a dashboard that displays the user's financial overview, including income, expenses, and savings.
- **Expense Tracking**: Allow users to input their expenses and categorize them (e.g., food, entertainment, bills).
- **Income Tracking**: Enable users to log their income sources and amounts.
- **Data Visualization**: Use libraries like Chart.js or D3.js to create visual representations of spending habits and income trends.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the application is mobile-friendly using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI.

## Technologies to Use

- **Frontend**: React.js for building the user interface, along with hooks (like `useState` and `useEffect`) for managing state and side effects.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for creating RESTful APIs to handle data storage and retrieval.
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store user data securely.
- **Deployment**: Host your application on platforms like Heroku or Vercel.

## Learning Outcomes

1. **State Management**: Gain hands-on experience with React's state management through hooks and context API.
2. **API Integration**: Learn how to make API calls using Axios or Fetch, handling asynchronous operations effectively.
3. **Data Visualization**: Understand how to represent data visually, which is a valuable skill in many roles.
4. **Authentication**: Implement secure authentication methods, a crucial aspect of modern web applications.
