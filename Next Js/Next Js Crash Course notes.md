next.env d.ts is a ts declaration file for next.js


![[Pasted image 20241110003548.png]]
allows us to configure next js like enable experimental options build settings etc


![[Pasted image 20241110003630.png]]

All assets go in this folder


node_modules => all dependedience required to run the rpoject



![[Pasted image 20241110003700.png]]

app folder contains the main application.
page.tsx is the entry point of the applciation #nextimportant



![[Pasted image 20241110003922.png]]

fonts like self hosting own fonts

favicon.ico appears on browser tab

globals.css accepts custom css

layout.tsx main entry point for the application #nextimportant  Example we are importing fonts styles and meta data.


```js
import type { Metadata } from "next";

import localFont from "next/font/local";

import "./globals.css";

  

const geistSans = localFont({

  src: "./fonts/GeistVF.woff",

  variable: "--font-geist-sans",

  weight: "100 900",

});

const geistMono = localFont({

  src: "./fonts/GeistMonoVF.woff",

  variable: "--font-geist-mono",

  weight: "100 900",

});

  

export const metadata: Metadata = {

  title: "Create Next App",

  description: "Generated by create next app",

};

  

export default function RootLayout({

  children,

}: Readonly<{

  children: React.ReactNode;

}>) {

  return (

    <html lang="en">

      <body

        className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}

      >

        {children}

      </body>

    </html>

  );

}
```







### React Server Components
Html elements rendered on the server can access server side resources directly
file system, reduces amount of js 

Client Compoents
Clicking buttons navigating to other pages 
To use them in next js use "use client" directive
![[Pasted image 20241110165604.png]]

Furhter reading when to use server side and client side rendering in next js from the docs.

Server side pre redering
Client side compoennt satic assets that is the prats of the page that will not have user interaction is rendered on the server side, while the interactive parts are sent with placehodlers for the browser to process.


### Creating Routes in Next Js
![[Pasted image 20241110170328.png]]
Create a directory with a name about
Inside it create a page.tsx file this is the entry point
Then, ![[Pasted image 20241110170357.png]]
We see the route is automatically created.


Uses file based routing system
folders are used as routes
![[Pasted image 20241110170432.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241110170449.png]]


![[Pasted image 20241110170502.png]]

Folder name becomes the route name and hte page defined becomes the route.


#### Nested routes
Example route dashboard/users and dashboard/analytics you cannot create two folderrs with same name.

So, inside dashboard folder you create two folder analytics and users.
![[Pasted image 20241110170819.png]]
With this structure you will have the required pages for the correspdoning endpoints.



### Dybamic Routes
![[Pasted image 20241110170905.png]]

Example we hve a list of users and clicking on any of them will take us to their corresponding detail page that accepts an user id
we need not create folder for each of them as it is not possible, 

To create dynamic route:
Wrap the part that changes in square brackets and create a directory. Then you should proceed to 



How to extract the dynamic parameter from the folder ?
- Using hte params object as props




### Layout Page:
This contains basic skeleton within which the content is displaetd. "layout.tsx" is the file name to describe the page. Mst render children in every layout file

Folder parenthesis means rotue group. Makes the code more readable without breaking the routes.
![[Pasted image 20241110171930.png]]
The root endpoint contains the about page, while hte dashboard endpoint arer asscoiated with the dashboard directory.

Root route group must point to hte primary home page.



### Error handling
Done in the file with name error. Each folder can have its own error file.
![[Pasted image 20241110172216.png]]
To handle global errors we can create a new file called global error.tsx

![[Pasted image 20241110172307.png]]

Error boundaries must be client component.
Only the closest error file to the route takes priority so if an error occurs in dashboard route then we will get the corresponding error screen specific to that route.


### Loading UI

add "loading.dependingonusingtsorjs" file to the directory and that will used for all the paths in directory.

There are other things as well parallel routes, intercepting routes, and localization routes





### data Fetching

Automatic request de duplication:
When same dat ais requested muliple times at once only one request gets ent

Imrpoved Security
=> Api keys can never be exposed
do not lead to request water fall when request are made seuqnetlillay
Server side can paralleize request 



## Static site generation
html page generaetd at build time content create during site deplouyment
not when user request
extreamly fast and deployd oncdn

(what is cdn)

Cannot work on website that require frequently updating content


### Static Rendering (default)
build is cahced and build upon from cdn

Incremental static regeration
Update static content after the content has been built.
want to use isr 
![[Pasted image 20241112011611.png]]

![[Pasted image 20241112011654.png]]
this paticular page compoent will be done in 3600

ISR needs more look

cache no store
PPR partial pre rendering



## API Routing
![[Pasted image 20241112011935.png]]

folder api can have any name but the route file is specific to next.
