- They allow us to organize the files into logical groups without affecting the URL path structure.![[Pasted image 20250430191621.png]]
- Right now the loading is applied to all the child routes of dashboard including customers and invoices. We want only for the main dashboard.
- To achieve it add a folder name enclosed within ()
- Route groups allow you to organize files into logical groups without affecting the URL path structure. When you create a new folder using parentheses `()`, the name won't be included in the URL path. So `/dashboard/(overview)/page.tsx` becomes `/dashboard`.

Here, you're using a route group to ensure `loading.tsx` only applies to your dashboard overview page. However, you can also use route groups to separate your application into sections (e.g. `(marketing)` routes and `(shop)` routes) or by teams for larger applications.
