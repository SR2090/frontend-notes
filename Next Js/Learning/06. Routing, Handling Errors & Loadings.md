### CReating an Api route
Create a new folder inside the app folder,
Inside this folder, create a page.tsx file

### Grouped Routes

Same pattern with nested folder, the content will be defined inside page.tsx

### Dyanmic Routes
- Routes which have a dyanmic parameter such as an id. Example user/user-1, user/user-2, .. .. . .user/user-n
To create:
Wrap the dynamic part of the route in square brackets.

This is the main user layout
#### Extracting the dynamic path from the api route

![[Pasted image 20241126165056.png]]
```ts
import React from 'react'

  

function UserId({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {

  const { id } = params;

  return (

    <div>UserId - {id}</div>

  )

}

  

export default UserId
```

If we want to get access to this id from outside of a next js page then i can use 'useParams' hook to obtain the route id.

## Layouts
Layout.tsx is the parent for all of the routes

The ROOT will appear on all the other pages
Share UI elements across multiple pages

root layout is mandatory
Each folder structure has a root layout. The root layout describes what the layout of that particular folder structure will be like. All the children elements what how they will look like. Now in order to use this, I need to define the layout and it will be shared across all the different page layouts. For example, I have the folder structure in which I have the dashboard folder and it has a page. Now whenever I hit the dashboard API endpoint, the page layout will be displayed. Now under it we have. Corresponding child. And whenever I need to hit that, like hit any of those children, the dashboard page will be the parent page and inside that the corresponding pages of those children will be laid out.
## Route Groups

In next we are using file based routing. This means that inside any folder, whatever file we are creating, the name of that folder becomes the name of your endpoint. If we want to avoid that because as we know we are using folder for organising. To organise our structure better, we would want to keep say let's say under dashboard. We want to keep the analytics page and the user should not come under dashboard, so that should come under, let's say extras so we can. Wrap these pages or wrap these folder names around parenthesis and it will not appear on the API endpoint.



The benefits of route group is that it allows us to organise our folder structure better and it allows us to have separate layout for different route groups that may have different appearances.


### Error Handling

Error handling in Nextjs is done through the error.ts file TypeScript and each each route group has its own error dot TS file to handle error specific to that file. The parent folder, the root directory will have the error dot TS file that will handle the error for all the application that will handle application wide error.
