Using async server component
Better for SEO, prevents call deduplication like duplicate API call will be API call outs in on the server are more secure when compared to client side API codes as it has to do with the visibility of API keys but even on the client side the API keys are hidden in case of client side API request it leads to network waterfall that means there is sequential call out and each call out can actually increase the overall load page time.
While when calling making API call out on the server we can use parallelism to request multiple API calls simultaneously


Make direct server calls

to use client side fetching we have to use the use client directive and then we will use our state and use effect hook


there are different server side strategies that describe how and when we want to render content on the client side

## Static Site Generation
in static side generation the web pages are created during the build time or as soon as we deploy the website.
this strategy is not suitable for website that frequently operating content as the website is built during build time or during 

## Incremental Static Regeration
During build time the static content is loaded and after some time this content is again refreshed. this strategy is suitable for websites whose content changes seldomly but still it changes.

This can be done in two ways first one is time based revalidation ![[Pasted image 20241127214902.png]]

Just this variable is enough to to inform that the page needs to be reevaluated after 3600 seconds 
when I say page here it means that the entire route on whose page we have added this export so all the data fetch that is going to happen in this page will be revalidated after the specified number of seconds. This is called a "route segment config"

![[Pasted image 20241127215012.png]]
this is the second way in which we are revalidating the request after the specified amount of time.

The difference between these two methods the first method it is for the entire route meaning that all the fetching that is going to happen in the happened in that page will be done after that number of seconds specified in revalidate while the second one is using the revalidate option that next provide for fetch and it is only specific to that data fetch call


there is another on demand re - validation


## SErver Side Rendering
in this strategy the HTML of the page is better on the server this puts more load on the server but the beauty of this strategy is that it is useful for pages where we have huge number of interactive elements present

to utilise this strategy we can set the route config or export which is that revalidate keyword to 0 or for a specific API call they can set the keyword the next specific fetch keyword to no cache true or revalidate 0

## Partial Pre rendering
this strategy combines static and dynamic rendering. In this strategy static shell of the pages built during the deployment of the web page and placeholders are kept at the places where the content will be dynamic. the dynamic components are wrapped in the suspense.

On page request this static cell is immediately served because there is almost no warhead as it was already prepared during the build time and once it is served the dynamic content is then fetched according to the user request
