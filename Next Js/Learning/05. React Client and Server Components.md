What type of component is this ?
- Server or client ?
- SErver as the console.log proves it![[Pasted image 20241126133522.png]]


Rendering on server allows the component access server side components directly
Reduces amount of js sent to frontend.
Excellent to access files in file system, keep secrets, etc

Why not make every component server component ?
Component interactivity, (btn click navigating to pages, submitting forms etc)

Client compoennt will be renderd on the clietn.
To use them in next js use
```ts
'use client'
```
