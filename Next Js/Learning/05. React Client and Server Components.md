What type of component is this ?
- Server or client ?
- SErver as the console.log proves it![[Pasted image 20241126133522.png]]


Rendering on server allows the component access server side components directly
Reduces amount of js sent to frontend.
Excellent to access files in file system, keep secrets, etc

Why not make every component server component ?
Component interactivity, (btn click navigating to pages, submitting forms etc)

![[Pasted image 20241126133823.png]]
Client compoennt will be renderd on the clietn.
To use them in next js use
```ts
'use client'
```

React has introduced a distinction between **Server Components** and **Client Components** to optimize performance, simplify data fetching, and reduce client-side JavaScript.

## React Server Components

### What Are They?

- **Rendered on the Server:**  
    React Server Components (RSC) run on the server and output HTML (or a serialized representation) that is sent to the client. They don’t include the JavaScript code needed for interactivity on the client side.
    
- **No Client-Side State or Effects:**  
    Since they render on the server, these components cannot use **client-only features like hooks for state (`useState`), effects (`useEffect`), or browser APIs (e.g., `window` or `document`).**
    
- **Benefits:**
    
    - **Reduced Bundle Size:** No need to ship JavaScript for these components to the client.
        
    - **Improved Performance:** Rendering on the server means you can fetch data directly and stream the HTML to the client.
        
    - **Simplified Data Fetching:** They can directly access secure data sources (e.g., databases) without exposing credentials in client bundles.
        

### Example of a Server Component

Imagine you have a component that fetches a list of blog posts. This component doesn’t need any interactivity on the client.

```jsx
// File: components/BlogPosts.server.jsx
export default async function BlogPosts() {
  // Simulate fetching data (this code only runs on the server)
  const posts = await fetchPostsFromDatabase();

  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

// Simulated data fetching function
async function fetchPostsFromDatabase() {
  return [
    { id: 1, title: "Server Components in React" },
    { id: 2, title: "Understanding React Architecture" },
  ];
}
```

**Key Points:**

- The component file might be named with a `.server.jsx` or placed in a folder that indicates its server-only nature.
    
- It can use async/await directly in the component.
    
- No client-side interactivity is needed.

## React Client Components

### What Are They?

- **Rendered on the Client:**  
    Client Components are **fully interactive**. They run in the browser and can handle state, effects, events, and other browser-specific APIs.
    
- **Bundle Size Consideration:**  
    Because they require JavaScript on the client, you should keep them as lean as possible to optimize performance.
    
- **When to Use:**  
    Use Client Components when you need:
    
    - Interactivity (e.g., button clicks, form submissions)
        
    - Local component state and side effects
        
    - Direct access to browser APIs
        

### Example of a Client Component

Consider a button that toggles a count. This is clearly interactive and must be rendered on the client.

```jsx
// File: components/Counter.client.jsx
"use client"; // This directive tells Next.js or similar frameworks that this is a client component

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Key Points:**

- The `"use client";` directive at the top signals that this component must be bundled and run on the client.
    
- It uses `useState` to handle interactive state and event handlers like `onClick`.
    

---

## When to Use What

### Use **Server Components** when:

- You need to fetch data from a database or API securely.
    
- The component is purely presentational with no client-side interactivity.
    
- You want to reduce the amount of JavaScript sent to the client.
    
- The component can be rendered ahead of time (static content).
    

**Example Use Cases:**

- Static pages or content that doesn’t change on user interactions.
    
- Components that aggregate data from multiple sources.
    

### Use **Client Components** when:

- Interactivity is required (e.g., forms, modals, counters).
    
- You need to manage local component state or side effects.
    
- The component uses browser-specific APIs (like `window` or `document`).
    
- You’re building components that rely on user events or animations.
    

**Example Use Cases:**

- Interactive dashboards.
    
- User input forms.
    
- Components that require live updates or subscriptions.

## Combining Both in an Application

In a typical application, you might mix server and client components. For instance, a page could be rendered on the server for fast initial load (data fetching, SEO benefits) and include interactive client components where necessary.

### Example: Page Combining Both

```jsx
// File: pages/BlogPage.server.jsx
import BlogPosts from '../components/BlogPosts.server';
import Counter from '../components/Counter.client';

export default function BlogPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Blog</h1>
      {/* Server-rendered list of posts */}
      <BlogPosts />
      {/* Client-side interactive component */}
      <Counter />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example:

- The `BlogPosts` component is rendered on the server. It efficiently fetches and displays data.
    
- The `Counter` component is rendered on the client, providing interactivity.

## Summary

- **React Server Components** are used for data fetching and rendering static content on the server without client-side JavaScript overhead.
    
- **React Client Components** are used for interactivity, state management, and any browser-specific functionality.
    
- **When to use what:**  
    Use server components for static or data-heavy UI that doesn't require interactivity, and client components for parts of your UI that need to respond to user actions.
    

By mixing these approaches, you can optimize your app’s performance and provide a seamless user experience.
