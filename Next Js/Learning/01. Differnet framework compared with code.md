Next is an extension of react.
Next js as a backend framework is easier to setup, and the file struture based routing makes api endpoints easier.

React has react server side component, but next automates several build steps which increases the velocity of production.

One of the biggest drawback of React is poor SEO, it is as a result that the webpage gets build on the client side on demand. While Next can send a rendered webpage directly to browser that can be accessed by web crawler. 

A minimal html fiel coupled with a huge js file is sent by the server to react. The browser builts the resuling webapge whcih cannot be accessed by the crawler.
In next when using SSG or SSR the seerver sends the entire html webpage to the client with minial js for interactivity, allowing the crawler to index each individual page accordingly.
