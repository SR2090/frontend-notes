## When to use client vs server side
both are react components whether different lines in where they are rendered

tried complaints are entered on the users uh device whereas the server components are rendered on the server and then provided to the client

the benefit of rendering it in the server is that we can generate a skeleton there which will contain our static components and this can be immediately sent to the client device now we can send a small bundle of JavaScript to generate the interactive part of our page so overall we will reduce our bundle size. This will improve our website response time
