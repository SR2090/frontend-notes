[Lodash documentation](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#debounce)



Wrong implementation
```js
function debounce(fn, delay) {
	//code here
	let timer;
	return function (...args) {
	    console.log(this, "Inner");    
	    clearTimeout(timer);
	    timer = setTimeout(() => {return fn(...args)}, delay);
	}
}

const obj = {
  name: "Alice",
  log() {
    console.log(this.name); // `this` should be `obj`
  },
};

const debouncedLog = debounce(obj.log, 300);
debouncedLog(); // ❌ Logs `undefined` (or throws an error in strict mode)


```

Inner will return the global object because debouncedLog is not called as an object method but as normal method in the global scope.
Therefore it is important for us to use apply for executing the method

```js
function debounce(fn, delay) {
	//code here
	let timer;
	return function (...args) {
	    console.log(this, "Inner");    
	    clearTimeout(timer);
	    timer = setTimeout(() => {return fn.apply(this, args)}, delay);
	}
}
```

**Using arrow function for the outer returned function:** ❌ This is not advisable if you need the `this` context from the call site.
Which means if we return an arrow function from debounced method it will not correctly capture the this context.
```js
function debounce(fn, delay) {
	//code here
	let timer;
	return (...args) => {
	    console.log(this, "Inner");    
	    clearTimeout(timer);
	    timer = setTimeout(() => {return fn.apply(this, args)}, delay);
	}
}

const obj = {
  name: "Alice",
  log() {
    console.log(this.name);
  },
};

const debouncedLog = debounce(obj.log, 300);
debouncedLog();

```

What does tick mean ?
- Event loop iteration, async task like setTimeout are executed once then synchronous task are done.
In this context, a "tick" refers to an iteration of the JavaScript event loop, which processes tasks in the execution queue. When the documentation says that the function invocation is "deferred until the next tick," it means the execution of the function will be postponed until the event loop completes its current cycle and processes the pending tasks in the queue.

### Event Loop in JavaScript:

JavaScript is single-threaded, and its execution model is based on an event loop. The event loop consists of the following phases:

1. **Execution of Synchronous Code**: All synchronous tasks are executed in order first.
2. **Queueing of Asynchronous Tasks**: Asynchronous operations like `setTimeout`, promises, and events are queued for execution after the synchronous code finishes.
3. **Processing the Queue**: The event loop processes these queued tasks one at a time, in the order they were added.

### What Happens with `setTimeout(func, 0)`?

When `setTimeout` is used with a timeout of `0`, it doesn't execute the callback immediately. Instead:

1. The `setTimeout` callback is placed in the event loop queue.
2. The callback will only execute after the current execution stack is cleared and the next tick of the event loop begins.

### In the Context of the Documentation:

If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, the function will not be executed immediately. Instead:

1. The call to the debounced function schedules the `func` execution for the next tick.
2. This behavior is similar to using `setTimeout(func, 0)`, which delays the invocation until the current execution context is cleared.

For example:

javascript

Copy code

`console.log('Start');  setTimeout(() => console.log('Executed in next tick'), 0);  console.log('End');`

**Output:**

sql

Copy code

`Start End Executed in next tick`

Here, "Executed in next tick" appears after "End" because the `setTimeout` callback is deferred to the next tick. Similarly, the debounced function in your documentation behaves this way when `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`.
