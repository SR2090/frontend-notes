React functional component has React.FC type. Between the angle brackets we define our own prop types.![[Pasted image 20241005165808.png]]
The items are specific to this component. Using the React.FC type will allow props object to have children property. 
We can use optional prop to enforce the inability of the prop to be present.



### Just learn
- Add React.FC to all custom components.
- Add your own types in the generic to access them with the prop.
- Using React.FC the old props get merged with the base props.
