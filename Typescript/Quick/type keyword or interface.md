In interface after declaration we can re add declaration by keeping the name same and adding new properties to that name.

This is called declaration merging.
	Its mostly useful for interfaces  that are coming from other file, libraries or in cases where you cannot directly add the required property to your source.

The same thing cannot be done for type.


Interfaces can be extended, ^extend-interface
