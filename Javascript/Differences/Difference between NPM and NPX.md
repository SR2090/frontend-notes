The main difference between **npm** and **npx** lies in their purposes and use cases:

### 1. **npm (Node Package Manager)**:

- **Purpose**: It is primarily used to manage dependencies for a project, allowing you to install, uninstall, update, and manage JavaScript packages and modules.
- **Commands**:
    - `npm install`: Installs a package from the npm registry.
    - `npm init`: Initializes a new project with a `package.json` file.
    - `npm run`: Runs scripts defined in the `package.json` file.

**Key Point**: `npm` installs packages globally or locally (in your project), and you need to manage these installations manually.

### 2. **npx (Node Package Executor)**:

- **Purpose**: It is a package runner tool that comes with npm (as of version 5.2+). `npx` allows you to execute binaries from npm packages without installing them globally.
- **Use Case**:
    - Instead of installing a package globally, you can use `npx` to run a package directly from the npm registry.
    - Example: `npx create-react-app my-app` runs the `create-react-app` package without needing to install it globally.

**Key Point**: `npx` simplifies running one-off commands from packages without installing them permanently on your machine.

### Summary:

- **npm** is used for **managing dependencies** (installing, updating, and running scripts).
- **npx** is used for **executing packages** without having to install them globally, especially useful for running CLI tools.
