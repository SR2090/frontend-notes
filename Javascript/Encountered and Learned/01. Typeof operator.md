The reason `typeof pathParam === "array"` **is wrong** is because in JavaScript, **`typeof` only returns a few specific types**, and `"array"` is not one of them. Specifically, `typeof` returns:

- `"object"` for objects (including arrays and `null`)
- `"function"` for functions
- `"string"`, `"number"`, `"boolean"`, `"undefined"`, `"symbol"`, and `"bigint"` for those respective primitive types

For arrays, `typeof` returns `"object"`, because arrays are a type of object in JavaScript.

To check if something is an array, you need to use `Array.isArray()` instead. So, the correct way to check if `pathParam` is an array is:

```js
Array.isArray(pathParam)
```
