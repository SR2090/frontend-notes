### **Currying in JavaScript**

Currying is a **functional programming technique** where a **function is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument**. Instead of taking multiple arguments at once, a curried function takes one argument and returns another function that takes the next argument, and so on.

Even simpler definition:
Currying is the technique of converting a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each takes a single argument.

### **Why Use Currying?**

- **Reusability**: You can create reusable specialized functions.
- **Function Composition**: Makes it easier to compose functions.
- **Avoids Repetition**: Helps avoid repeating the same parameters.

Implementing currying understand the following

- **Arity**: The number of arguments or operands taken by a function.
- **Closure**: A closure is the combination of a function bundled together with references to its lexical environment (surrounding state).
