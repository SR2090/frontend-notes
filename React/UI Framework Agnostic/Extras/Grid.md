the great template rows and grid template column defines the number of rows and columns

## Basic Grid

We can specify the gap property after each row or column value.

OR use the gap property. Content cannot fall in this gap.

Grid Overflowing because the gap + the width is exceeding the parent width.


The FR unit represents the fraction of space left in the grid container

When using this fr I will not have an overflow because the browser will take the gap into consideration and this fr unit into consideration to calculate the container width in a way that it does not exceed the width of its parent
