Anytime react will update the DOM it will be considered as re-render

React creates website who's content changes quickly.![[Pasted image 20241101133318.png]]
Anytime we are appending, removing, and updating elements in the dom we are going to get a re-render.


In case of a counter app when the number updates from 0 => 1, 2, 3 etc i.e. when it changes then re-render is taking place.

Minimize re-render especially for mobile apps, and games. The idea of optimizing in react is to write code in a way such that you are only re-rendering things that are required to be re-rendered.


```js
import React, { useState } from "react";

  

function App() {

  const [state, setState] = useState("Dummy");

  const handleClick = () => {

    setState(Math.random());

  };

  

  return (

    <div className="App">

      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me to change the header</button>

      <Header title={`This heading will get changed - ${state}`} />

      <Header title="This heading will not get changed" />

    </div>

  );

}

  

const Header = ({ title }) => {

  return (

    <div>

      <h2>{title}</h2>

    </div>

  );

};

  

export default App;
```
Consider the above code we would ideally want only the second div that contains the state variable to get updated.
However, in reality the entire component is getting updated. App should get update because one of the child is getting updated and so does the header with state. But why is the static content also getting updated ?

The state title is getting updated, and react says anytime the state is updated the entire component is re-rendered. Hence, all the corresponding children are also re-rendering.



## Optimize the component: 
![[Pasted image 20241101135549.png]]Push the title state variable to a separate component as only that component is getting updated with the button call.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

  

function App() {

  return (

    <div className="App">

      <HeaderWithButton />

      <Header title="This heading will not get changed" />

    </div>

  );

}

  

const Header = ({ title }) => {

  return (

    <div>

      <h2>{title}</h2>

    </div>

  );

};

  

const HeaderWithButton = () => {

  const [state, setState] = useState("Dummy");

  const handleClick = () => {

    setState(Math.random());

  };

  return (

    <>

      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me to change the header</button>

      <Header title={`This heading will get changed - ${state}`} />

    </>

  );

};

export default App;
```
The re-render will now only be limited to the HeaderWithButton component. 


### Things to remember:
Push down the state as much as possible. This will cause the child to re-render instead of the parent which will cause other unrelated component to also re-render.
