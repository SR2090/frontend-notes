**Machine Coding**

- Create a Modal Component on click of button and display it in the middle of the page
    
- Create a react application for create reusable table where we have pass only column and data so different team also used the same component
    
- Did you know about this technique called event delegation?how would you for example, let me say that you have already completed the parent element and if you are taking on some child element and how would you figure out that this exact child element has to be repeated?
    
- Implement a useFetch hook that can handle API calls with loading and error states.(Code)
    
- Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9 Output: [0, 1]
