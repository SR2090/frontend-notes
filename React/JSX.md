### **What is JSX?**

JSX (**JavaScript XML**) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript. It is mainly used in **React** to describe what the UI should look like.

### **Example**

#### **Without JSX (Using plain JavaScript)**

`const element = React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello, world!");`

#### **With JSX**


`const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;`

ðŸ‘‰ JSX makes it easier to write and understand UI components.
