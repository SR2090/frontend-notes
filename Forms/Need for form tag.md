Using the `<form>` tag in HTML provides several benefits for building web applications:

1. **User Input Handling**: The `<form>` tag groups input elements (like text fields, radio buttons, and checkboxes), making it easier to manage user inputs.
    
2. **Built-in Submission Mechanism**: Forms have an `action` attribute that specifies where data should be sent when submitted, and a `method` attribute that determines how data is sent (e.g., via `POST` or `GET`). This simplifies the process of sending data to the server.
    
3. **Validation Support**: HTML5 forms include built-in validation for inputs, such as required fields and specific types like `email` or `number`, reducing the need for additional JavaScript.
    
4. **Keyboard Accessibility**: Forms support keyboard navigation, allowing users to easily navigate between inputs using the `Tab` key and submit the form with the `Enter` key.
    
5. **Styling and Layout**: Grouping related inputs within a `<form>` tag, often with `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` tags, provides semantic structure, making styling easier and improving layout consistency.
    
6. **Security and Consistency**: Using `<form>` for handling data submission is a more standardized, secure approach than manually submitting data, as it prevents CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerabilities when implemented with backend security features.
    
7. **JavaScript Interactions**: Forms emit events like `submit` and `reset`, allowing you to hook into these events with JavaScript to create interactive experiences, like showing validation errors before submitting.
    

Overall, the `<form>` tag simplifies data handling, enhances user experience, and makes building forms more consistent and accessible across web applications.
