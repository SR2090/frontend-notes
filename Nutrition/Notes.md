Additionally, it’s a good idea to weigh foods in their uncooked state. The amount of time a food is cooked for affects how much moisture it retains. A food with higher water content before cooking weighs more, but it has the same nutrition profile after it is cooked when it weighs less because the water has evaporated from cooking. The opposite is true for foods like dried pasta and rice which weight more after cooking due to an increased water content. Since you won’t always cook foods for the exact same length of time,f1 a good way to ensure consistent measurement and tracking is to weigh foods prior to cooking.

The estimation of caloric intake that would simply keep you at your current body weight is referred to as your maintenance calories. 

Some popular databases are FitGenie, MyFitnessPal, LiveStrong, FitDay, MyMacros, and CalorieKing, but there are many others. 



What I recommend is to have a daily weigh-in first thing in the morning, after you use the bathroom, before you eat or drink anything, nude, and record the number. It’s not that we care about the single day’s weigh-in (we don’t, and focusing too much on your daily weight can drive you crazy [16]), rather it’s that you’re going to use your daily weigh-ins to generate an average weight for the week.


The estimation of caloric intake that would simply keep you at your current body weight is referred to as your maintenance calories


To begin, you must obtain a digital body weight scale, a digital food scale, and an online account with a free food-tracking database like MyFitnessPal (or others)



At the end of two weeks, you will have 14 weigh-ins and 14 calorie values. First, determine your average caloric intake by adding all 14 calorie values together and dividing by 14. Now, if you only got say 3–4 weighins per week, and 3–4 days of tracked calories, that’s fine, just so long as they were evenly distributed and represented your normal habits. Specifically, if you tracked and weighed Mon-Fri and but you didn’t on the weekends when you typically go out to eat more, that’s probably not going to be accurate. Do your best to record all your habits, don’t judge them or modify them, and estimate as best as possible when eating out. So, if you’ve done that, let’s say as an example, this value came out to 2100 calories.
Then, split your weigh-ins into 2 weekly averages, by adding your first 7 weigh-ins together and dividing by 7 and doing the same thing with your last 7 weigh-ins as seen below.

THE MUSCLE & STRENGTH PYRAMID: NUTRITION
adipose tissue contains ~3500 calories [1]. Therefore we can estimate how much of a surplus or deficit you are in based on weight change. While the “3500 calorie rule” isn’t perfect since not all weight gained or lost is fat and energy expenditure changes over time [2], this value is still a good way to roughly estimate maintenance calories.


multiply your body weight in kilograms by 22) and then multiply that value by an activity multiplier. As an example, let’s do a calculation for a male that weighs 200 lb (90 kg), when we multiply by 10 (22) we get a theoretical baseline of 2000 calories.

if you want to get started faster, just take the middle value of 1.7 as your multiplier. Then, if you gain or lose weight too quickly after 2–3 weeks, just adjust your intake. This is a perfectly valid approach as well.

if you are not gaining weight at an appropriate rate, try to be more full, and eat more calorie dense foods. If you are not seeing visual changes in leanness every 2–3 weeks (or weight loss on the scale, if you don’t feel like you can visually assess this) while trying to lose fat, try to be less full after meals, and eat more fibrous, high-protein, low-calorie foods that provide more satiety with less energy.

cut if you are high in body fat, gain if you are not. There is also an interaction with training experience. Indeed, I wouldn’t advise someone with obesity who is just starting a weight training program to purposely go on a fat loss plan. Just becoming more active alone can give someone who was previously sedentary more finely tuned hunger signals [4], and body-fat percentage will go down even if muscle is gained without fat mass losses. Also, metabolic health will improve purely from resistance training without dieting. In this case, I’d only advise you to institute a caloric deficit once the initial “magic” of newbie gains end, and if at that point you still had a goal of lowering your body fat (which as I said, may happen anyway just from lifting regularly).


In the case of someone who is generally not very muscular, but is also higher in body fat than average (often referred to as “skinny fat”; I’m not a fan of the term, but it hopefully helps you understand what I’m referring to), I also don’t recommend cutting. However, I also don’t really recommend gaining at the rates I recommend later in this chapter for novices either. In this case, once again, just let the magic of partaking in serious progressive resistance exercise (for guidelines check out The Muscle and Strength Training Pyramid) do its thing for 6 months, without focusing on instituting a significant deficit or surplus. With a low starting level of muscle mass, you’re ripe for putting on muscle regardless of your nutrition


There is a common notion that if you aren’t reasonably lean, efforts at gaining will produce a disproportionate amount of fat and little in the way of muscle. This concept is called your ‘P-ratio’, which is simply defined as the proportion of fat to muscle you put on when gaining weight. Indeed, there is research showing that very lean people — who are naturally lean, not who dieted — gain more lean body mass during periods of overfeeding, and people with obesity gain more body fat during periods of overfeeding [5].

However, what two things that are frequently misunderstood are: 1) putting on more lean body mass when overfeeding occurs in naturally lean people who walk around lean. If you dieted to get really lean, your body if anything, is actually a bit more primed for fat storage. Also; 2) that this relationship is based on observations of individuals who aren’t resistance training. If you start lifting weights this drastically changes the game. Nutrient partitioning in your now highly active skeletal muscle is much more favorable for muscle gain as you are providing a stimulus for growth and regularly depleting your muscle of energy and pushing them to become energy efficient and adapt. If it was true that individuals with a high body fat couldn’t gain muscle mass effectively, sumo wrestlers wouldn’t have the highest recorded lean body masses of any athlete...but they do [6].

recreational lifters, you probably don’t want to be so high in body fat at the start of a gaining phase that you aren’t happy with your body shortly after starting it. Essentially, in each case you want enough of a runway to be able to spend at least a few months in a surplus. My rough guidelines are a maximum of ~15% body fat for men and ~23% body fat for women for beginning a gaining phase.

A general recommendation (for those who aren’t starting with high body fat level) is to have a minimum of a 4:1 ratio of the time spent in a gaining phase vs a cutting phase. Thus, if you spent four months in a surplus putting on muscle, you earned yourself no more than one month to do a mini cut

now that you are no longer under the false impression that your gaining phase will be sabotaged if you don’t start it lean enough.

“If I go down 500 calories I drop a pound, so if I eat 500 calories I gain a pound.”), it often doesn’t work out that way. Remember that whole subconscious activity and metabolic regulation thing that we were talking about? That concept means that you may have to eat more or less than you expect to get the rate of weight loss or gain you desire.

energy expenditure during cardio requires you to determine a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) during exercise.

If you also track the time spent performing the cardio, and if you know your body weight, you can estimate caloric expenditure with reasonable accuracy. You burn approximately ~0.2, ~0.45 and ~0.7 kcal per 10 minutes per pound of body weight doing light (RPE 2 to 4 out of 10), moderate (RPE 5 to 7 out of 10) and vigorous (RPE 8 to 10 out of 10) cardio respectively, above what you would normally be burning doing everyday light activity in that same time period [8].

RPE 1–2 Very light effort. You can talk with ease. RPE 3–4 Light effort. You can talk with almost no difficulty. RPE 5
Moderately light effort. You can talk comfortably with minor difficulty.
RPE 6 RPE 7 RPE 8 RPE 9 RPE 10
Moderate effort. You can talk with minor difficulty. Moderately high effort. Talking is difficult. High effort. Talking is very difficult.
Very high effort. Talking is maximally difficult. Maximal effort. Talking is impossible.


Below is a chart displaying the number of calories burned during 10 minutes of cardio activity at 3 different levels of intensity for individuals at 3 different body weights:

“Hold on, if I did an hour of moderate intensity cardio a day, that would put me slightly over a 3500 kcal deficit per week and I would be able to lose a pound weekly which is at a rate of ~0.5%. That’s what you prescribe and I wouldn’t have to restrict my food!” Well, he wouldn’t be wrong, but 7 hours of moderate-intensity cardio per week can cause problems for someone interested in muscle and strength.


Doing cardiovascular exercise at moderate intensities is essentially endurance training. The adaptations and the work required to produce endurance adaptations can interfere with the training and adaptations required to generate muscular strength, hypertrophy, and power [9].

For someone in decent shape who is lifting weights, casual cardio is not an adaptive stress, so it won’t cause endurance adaptations in the body. Thus, interference is not an issue with low-intensity cardio. However, the calorie burn is much lower when doing low-intensity cardio compared to higher intensities, and thus, you have to do a lot of it for it to add up.


Also, the risk of interference seems to be reduced when HIIT is utilized because the high-intensity nature of the cardio is more similar to resistance training 


While a larger risk of injury (with certain modalities) and a greater need for recovery are the only risks of HIIT, these are significant risks. It’s hard to make the argument that you are avoiding interference and retaining more muscle by avoiding moderate-intensity cardio and doing highintensity cardio when you have a hamstring tear.

majority of fat loss should come from the diet. Secondly, resistance training performance is the most critical aspect of muscle maintenance.

As a rule of thumb, your total cardio for the week should take no more than half the time you spend lifting weights. So if you spend 90 minutes 4 times per week lifting weights (6 hours), that means you should do no more than 3 total hours of cardio per week

In the example of lifting 6 hours per week and doing 3 hours of cardio, you could perform two 30 minute HIIT sessions, 1 hour of moderateintensity cardio, and 1 hour of low-intensity cardio as one way of doing the absolute maximum amount that should be performed

In fact, a 12-week study comparing rates of weight gain in resistance-trained athletes found that the group that consumed a small surplus gained the same amount of muscle and strength, but only one fifth the body fat as the group that consumed an additional 600 calories [16].

a great deal of individual variability in how much muscle people can gain.

The takeaway is that even if you don’t expend a ton of calories in training if you maintain a leaner physique than your body “wants” (which often requires a lower energy intake than your body needs to maintain full functionality), there can be health and performance consequences.

Calories are primarily delivered in the form of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, which are called macronutrients, or ‘macros
To close it out, we will go over fiber intake recommendations for health and nutrient absorption.

does not give respect to how much of a ‘caloric budget’ you might have. If you happen to have a relatively low or high energy expenditure for your body mass and you determine all three macros based purely on your body weight, you could very well eat so much or so little that you’d be inadvertently gaining weight or losing weight faster or slower than is appropriate, subverting the goals of Level 1.

a percentage is always scaled to how many calories you are consuming.

Therefore, someone who is eating a lower protein intake than I would recommend, but who is dieting and losing 0.5 to 1% of their body weight per week, is likely going to maintain more muscle mass than someone

eating as much protein as I recommend while losing 1.5 to 2% of their body weight per week. So, remember that the rank of importance of each level continues to matter. Additionally, protein can only do so much to protect against losses of lean body mass while dieting.

During a diet, this amount increases for several reasons. First, greater levels of activity increase protein requirements [2] and activity goes up when cardio is performed in addition to weight training during a diet. Additionally, protein is used more for fuel because less fat and carbs are available due to caloric restriction [3]. Finally, with less dietary carbohydrate and fat available, more glycogen and body fat are utilized; as their stores decrease, this forces the body to rely more on protein as an energy source [4].

Fundamentally, whether or not you gain lean tissue is determined by the combined factors of muscle protein breakdown and muscle protein synthesis (the creation of new muscle proteins).


However, published data points out that the primary culprit causing a negative protein turnover ratio may not necessarily be the increase in breakdown rates, but rather a decrease in muscle protein synthesis

At this stage, we don’t have the data to confidently know how it all plays out. However, to be safe, most protein researchers currently advise consuming higher protein in the range of 0.7 to 1.2 g/lb (1.6–2.7 g/kg) while dieting to offset body protein losses to help preserve muscle mass

In dietetics parlance, whether something is essential or not is defined by whether or not your body can synthesize it on its own.

So with fat intake, I recommend 15–25% of calories while you are dieting for most people, and then the remaining calories are assigned as carbs. Yes, 15% is lower than ideal in most cases, but that’s why diets don’t last forever.
However, some people do seem to do fine on lower-carb, higher-fat diets while dieting (although for strength athletes and bodybuilders I normally advise against full-blown ketogenic diets, more on those later) so in these individuals who have a track record to prove the efficacy of a lower-carb approach, an intake as high as 40% is appropriate.
Additionally, we’ll discuss a physiological minimum based on body weight in a moment. But in general, keeping fat a touch lower while dieting allows you to consume more carbohydrate and it’s important to retain enough carbohydrate so you can sustain your training, and in turn, so you can sustain your muscle mass

fat, it is an essential nutrient.

using the guidelines in this book you may end up inappropriately low in your intake of fat or carbohydrate. To prevent this, use the minimum intakes of 0.25 g/lb (~0.5 g/kg) for dietary fat, and 0.5 g/lb (~1 g/kg) for dietary carbohydrate. Also, in some cases you may find to maintain these minimums, you have to accept a slower rate of weight loss than you might like. If

I think it’s a good idea to just accept a slower rate of body weight loss than it is to take your fats or carbs below 0.5 and 1 g/kg, respectively, as this gives you the best shot at maximal muscle mass retention.

Think of it this way, you’ve got the calories to support you when gaining. Part of the reason why dieting theoretically requires more protein is because more protein is used for energy when you’re leaner and restricting calories [

we can have a higher percentage of our calories coming from fat. For most people I recommend 20–30% of total calories, but if you prefer higher fat intakes and lower carbs or have good data to show this works better for you, you can go up to 40% (more on this later)

Calculating Protein Intake Let’s start with 1 gram of protein per pound (2.2 g/kg) of body weight. As he weighs 200 lb, we set daily protein intake at 200 grams.
We need to calculate the daily calorie intake from protein so that we can find our fat and carbohydrate figures, so let’s do that first:
Daily caloric intake from protein
= grams of protein x calories per gram
= 200 x 4 = 800 kcal
Calculating Fat Intake We will then set fat at 25% of his total calories for the day, which is halfway between our 20-30% recommendation. Here’s how we calculate that:
Daily caloric intake from fat
= daily caloric intake x (fat intake percentage ÷ 100)
= 3200 x 0.25 = 800 kcal

could set up a daily macronutrient intake goal of 225 grams of protein, 55 grams of fat, and 275 grams of carbohydrate.

this isn’t to say keto diets are useless, but rather have pros and cons. In the literature relevant to sport, exercise, and body composition, they are a mixed bag of positive, negative, and neutral effect
