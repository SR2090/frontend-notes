#### Theory of dopamine
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter which makes us anticipate rewards such as having sexual relationships or eating nourishing food. Dopamine gives us the desire to take action to earn the exciting reward that’s waiting for us

Contrary to what many people believe, dopamine is not a pleasure chemical. Simply because an event triggers the release of dopamine doesn’t mean it is something we like or get pleasure from. In fact, when you pay close attention, you’ll notice that as soon as you obtain the expected reward, you’ll often feel empty and unfulfilled.

### What is wrong ?
Dopamine as the “molecule of more”. This is because the more our environment or actions trigger the release of dopamine, the more we’ll want our next “shot” of dopamine. 

By continuously triggering the release of dopamine through different means —such as drug or alcohol consumption—addicts actually strengthen their tolerance to such stimulation. As a result, they need stronger and stronger stimulus to experience the same sensation of pleasure

#### Defining addictions ?
What about you? Are you currently addicted to anything? If you can’t spend a day without engaging in a certain activity, it means you’re probably a little addicted to it.

#### Negatives of apps
Apps or content are designed to seek ur attention. It does so by hijacking your focus and making you unproductive and, as a result, restless.

Remember, dopamine is not a pleasure chemical; it is a neurotransmitter that is activated when you anticipate a potential pleasure. And that pleasure is usually temporary

### Hijacking ways:

Whenever you check your email, you’re expecting a reward, which could be a message from a friend or some exciting news. Whenever you check stats, such as investment portfolio, or website traffic stats, you expect a reward from seeing encouraging numbers. And the unpredictability makes it more exciting. Whenever you visit YouTube, you expect to watch interesting or exciting videos.
Whenever you visit social media sites, such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, you’re anticipating rewards such as likes or comments on your posts, messages from friends or interesting content.
