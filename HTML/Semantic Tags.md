2. **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**:
    
    - Search engines understand page structure better, improving indexing and ranking.
3. **Improved Readability**:
    
    - Semantic tags make HTML code easier for developers to read and maintain.
4. **Future-Proofing**:
    
    - Semantic tags are part of modern web standards, ensuring compatibility with newer technologies.
